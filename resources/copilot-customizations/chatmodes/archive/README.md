## Migration Notes

### planner.chatmode.md → plan.chatmode.md

The `planner.chatmode.md` was a minimal planning mode (15 lines) that has been fully superseded by `plan.chatmode.md` which provides:

- Comprehensive planning workflow guidelines
- Detailed tool usage instructions
- Best practices for analysis before implementation
- Collaborative strategy development patterns

**Action Required:** If you were using `planner.chatmode.md`, switch to `plan.chatmode.md` for enhanced capabilities.
