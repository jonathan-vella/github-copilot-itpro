## 💡 Pro Tips for Partner Success

### Pre-Sales
1. **Qualify Early**: Focus on customers with 5+ Azure professionals
2. **Speak Business Value**: Lead with ROI, not features
3. **Use Customer Language**: "Efficiency multiplier" not "AI assistant"
4. **Quantify Everything**: Time savings, cost reduction, payback period

### Demo Delivery
1. **Pause After Suggestions**: Let them see the "magic" happen
2. **Make Mistakes**: Show how Copilot helps fix errors (builds trust)
3. **Use Their Scenarios**: Customize demos to their actual work
4. **One Complete Demo**: Better to do one well than three rushed

### Objection Handling
1. **Listen for Underlying Concern**: Security objection often means "prove it's safe"
2. **Use Proof Points**: Data, case studies, customer references
3. **Turn into Opportunity**: "Great question" then demonstrate value
4. **End with Question**: Move conversation forward

### Post-Demo
1. **Send ROI Same Day**: While interest is fresh
2. **Reference Similar Customer**: Social proof matters
3. **Make Pilot Easy**: Low commitment, clear metrics, money-back guarantee
4. **Follow Up Weekly**: Stay top of mind
