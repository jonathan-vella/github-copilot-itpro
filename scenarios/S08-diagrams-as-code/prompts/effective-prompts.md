# Effective Prompts for Diagrams as Code

## Generating Initial Diagrams

- "Create a Python script using the `diagrams` library to visualize a standard Azure 3-tier architecture with a Load Balancer, VM Scale Set, App Service, and SQL Database."
- "Generate a diagram code for an AWS serverless architecture using Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB."

## Modifying Diagrams

- "Update the existing script to group the database and cache into a 'Data Layer' cluster."
- "Add a connection from the App Service to Application Insights for monitoring."
- "Change the direction of the diagram from Left-to-Right to Top-to-Bottom."

## Advanced Customization

- "How can I add custom labels to the edges in the `diagrams` library?"
- "Show me how to use custom icons with the `diagrams` library."
