# S08: Diagrams-as-Code with GitHub Copilot

---

## Meet Marcus Chen

> **Role**: Solutions Architect at TechVentures Ltd  
> **Experience**: 8 years in cloud architecture, expert in Azure and AWS  
> **Today's Challenge**: Design review meeting in 2 hours - needs to document a new microservices architecture  
> **The Twist**: He's heard about "diagrams-as-code" but has never used it

*"I've been dragging boxes in Visio for years. There has to be a better way - something I can version control
with my infrastructure code. But I don't have time to read documentation right now..."*

**What Marcus will discover**: How to use Copilot as a learning partner to understand diagrams-as-code concepts,
not just generate scripts. In 20 minutes, he'll go from "never used it" to creating professional architecture
diagrams he fully understands.

---

## Overview

This scenario demonstrates how GitHub Copilot serves as a **learning partner** for understanding diagrams-as-code
concepts, not just generating Python scripts. The goal is to build transferable knowledge so architects can
create and maintain architecture diagrams independently.

**Duration**: 20 minutes  
**Target Audience**: Cloud Architects, Solutions Architects, DevOps Engineers  
**Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Prerequisites**: VS Code with GitHub Copilot Chat (Python optional for running output)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this demo, participants will understand:

1. **What diagrams-as-code is** and when it's the right approach
2. **How to think architecturally** about visual representation
3. **The `diagrams` library structure** (Diagram → Cluster → Components → Edges)
4. **Icon sources and naming conventions** for Azure, AWS, GCP
5. **Connection operators** (`>>`, `<<`, `Edge()`) and styling
6. **Best practices** for team adoption and CI/CD integration
7. **Trade-offs** vs. traditional tools like Visio

## The Challenge: Traditional Diagramming Pain Points

| Problem | Impact | Business Cost |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| **Drift** | Diagrams become outdated as infrastructure changes | Wrong decisions from stale docs |
| **Inconsistency** | Different architects use different styles/icons | Confusion in reviews |
| **No Version Control** | Binary files (Visio, PPT) can't be diffed | No audit trail of changes |
| **Manual Effort** | Aligning boxes and arrows takes significant time | 30-45 min per diagram |
| **No Automation** | Can't regenerate when architecture changes | Always out of date |

## The Solution: Conversation-Based Learning

Instead of asking Copilot to "generate a diagram script," we use Copilot as a **teaching partner** to:

1. **Understand the concept** before writing code
2. **Think architecturally** about visual representation
3. **Learn the library structure** while building something real
4. **Build transferable skills** for future diagrams

## Scenario

**Character**: Marcus Chen, Solutions Architect at TechVentures Ltd  
**Situation**: Design review meeting in 2 hours. Needs to document a new microservices architecture.
Has never used diagrams-as-code before.

**Architecture to Document**:
- Azure Front Door (global entry point)
- AKS Cluster with 3 microservices (Product, Order, User)
- Azure SQL Database + Redis Cache (data tier)
- Key Vault + Application Insights (platform services)

**Traditional Approach**: 45 minutes in Visio dragging boxes  
**Conversation Approach**: 20 minutes learning + creating with understanding

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Conversation-First (Recommended)

1. Open VS Code with GitHub Copilot Chat
2. Review `examples/copilot-diagrams-conversation.md` for the approach
3. Start your own conversation:

   ```
   I need to document our Azure architecture for a design review. I've heard about
   diagrams-as-code but never used it. Can you help me understand if it's the right
   approach and walk me through creating a diagram?
   ```

4. Follow the 5-phase conversation flow (see below)

### Option 2: Watch the Demo

Review `examples/copilot-diagrams-conversation.md` to see a complete 20-minute conversation showing:
- Concept explanation (when to use diagrams-as-code)
- Architecture discovery (how to think about visual representation)
- Code generation with understanding
- Customization and iteration
- Best practices for teams

### Option 3: Run the Reference Solution

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install diagrams
sudo apt-get install graphviz  # Linux
# brew install graphviz        # Mac

# Generate diagram
cd solution/
python architecture.py

# View output
open ecommerce_architecture.png  # Mac
xdg-open ecommerce_architecture.png  # Linux
```

## Success Metrics

### Time Efficiency

| Metric | Traditional | With Copilot | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| First diagram | 45 min | 20 min | 56% faster |
| Subsequent diagrams | 30-45 min | 5-10 min | 78% faster |
| Updates/changes | 15-20 min | 2-3 min | 85% faster |

### Knowledge Transfer

| Metric | Script Generation | Conversation Approach |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| Understanding gained | Minimal | Complete |
| Can modify independently | Limited | Yes |
| Can teach others | No | Yes |
| Next diagram time | Same (ask again) | 78% faster |

### Quality Improvements

- ✅ **Version Control**: Full Git history of diagram changes
- ✅ **Consistency**: Same icons and styling across all diagrams
- ✅ **Automation**: CI/CD can regenerate on architecture changes
- ✅ **Review Process**: Code diffs show exactly what changed

## Business Value

### Time Savings Calculation

**Single Architect (First Year)**:
- Diagrams per month: 4
- Traditional time: 4 × 40 min = 160 min/month
- After learning: 4 × 8 min = 32 min/month
- Monthly savings: 128 minutes = 2.1 hours
- **Annual time saved: 25 hours**

**Team of 5 Architects**:
- Annual time saved: 25 × 5 = **125 hours/year (3+ work weeks)**
- Plus: Consistent quality, version control, automation

### Efficiency Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Time reduction per diagram | 80% |
| Annual hours saved (team of 5) | 125 hours |
| Learning curve | 20 min |
| Consistency improvement | 100% (templated) |

**Additional Benefits**: Version-controlled diagrams, automated generation, team standardization

## Use Cases

### 1. Design Reviews
**Need**: Professional architecture diagram in 2 hours  
**Approach**: Conversation to understand components → Generate diagram → Iterate styling  
**Outcome**: Clean, version-controlled diagram with full understanding

### 2. Documentation Updates
**Need**: Keep architecture docs current with infrastructure changes  
**Approach**: Modify Python code → Regenerate PNG → Commit both  
**Outcome**: Docs stay in sync with actual architecture

### 3. Team Standardization
**Need**: Consistent diagram style across 5 architects  
**Approach**: Shared styling module → CI/CD generation → PR reviews  
**Outcome**: Professional, consistent output from everyone

### 4. Client Deliverables
**Need**: High-quality diagrams for customer presentations  
**Approach**: Generate base diagram → Post-process for annotations  
**Outcome**: Professional deliverables in fraction of time

### 5. Architecture Decision Records
**Need**: Visual representation of architecture evolution  
**Approach**: Diagram per ADR → Git history shows changes  
**Outcome**: Visual audit trail of architecture decisions

## Troubleshooting

### Copilot Doesn't Understand Diagrams Library

**Symptom**: Generic Python code instead of `diagrams` library specifics

**Solution**: Be explicit about the library:
```
I want to use the Python 'diagrams' library by mingrammer (https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/).
Can you show me how to create an Azure architecture diagram with this specific library?
```

### Missing Azure Icons

**Symptom**: "No module named 'diagrams.azure.network'"

**Solution**: Check icon availability:
```
What Azure icons are available in the diagrams library? I need Front Door, AKS, SQL Database.
```

### Graphviz Not Found

**Symptom**: "ExecutableNotFound: failed to execute 'dot'"

**Solution**: Install Graphviz:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install graphviz

# Mac
brew install graphviz

# Windows
choco install graphviz
```

### Diagram Layout Issues

**Symptom**: Components not arranged as expected

**Solution**: Ask about layout options:
```
The components are arranged oddly. How can I control the layout direction and grouping
in the diagrams library?
```

## Next Steps

### For Presenters
1. Review `DEMO-SCRIPT.md` for the 20-minute walkthrough
2. Practice the conversation flow with Copilot
3. Prepare your own architecture example for live demo
4. Have backup: `examples/copilot-diagrams-conversation.md`

### For Learners
1. Start with `examples/copilot-diagrams-conversation.md`
2. Try your own architecture in a conversation
