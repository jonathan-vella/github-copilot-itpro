# Scenario: TechCorp Solutions - Infrastructure Standardization

## Company Profile

**Name**: TechCorp Solutions  
**Industry**: Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)  
**Size**: 450 employees, 15 development teams  
**Revenue**: Mid-market SaaS company  
**Cloud Maturity**: Intermediate (2 years on Azure)

### Business Context

TechCorp Solutions provides a multi-tenant SaaS platform for project management and collaboration. They operate in a competitive market where time-to-market and reliability are critical success factors.

**Recent Growth**:

- 3x customer growth in 18 months
- Expanded from 5 to 15 development teams
- Added 8 new features/quarter (up from 3)
- Launched in 3 new geographic markets

### Technical Landscape

**Current Azure Footprint**:

- 45 subscriptions (3 per team: dev, staging, prod)
- 600+ virtual machines
- 180+ App Services
- 90+ SQL Databases
- Multi-region deployment (North Europe, West US, Southeast Asia)

**Development Teams**:

- Each team owns 2-3 microservices
- Teams have autonomy to choose tools and patterns
- Mix of Bicep, ARM templates, manual Portal clicks
- Some teams using Terraform, but inconsistent patterns

---

## Current State Analysis

### Pain Points

#### 1. Infrastructure Inconsistency

**Problem**: Each development team deploys infrastructure differently.

**Examples**:

- **Team Alpha**: Uses Bicep with basic modules
- **Team Beta**: Manual Portal deployments with ARM export
- **Team Gamma**: Terraform v0.14 (outdated)
- **Team Delta**: Azure CLI scripts in Bash
- **Team Epsilon**: Mix of PowerShell and Portal

**Impact**:

- Impossible to audit security posture across teams
- No consistent naming or tagging
- Configuration drift between environments
- Difficult to share learnings or best practices

#### 2. Long Deployment Times

**Problem**: New environment provisioning takes 3-5 days per team.

**Breakdown**:

- **Day 1**: Research Azure services and patterns (4-6 hours)
- **Day 2**: Write infrastructure code (6-8 hours)
- **Day 3**: Debug deployment errors (4-8 hours)
- **Day 4**: Security review and remediation (3-6 hours)
- **Day 5**: Documentation and handoff (2-4 hours)

**Impact**:

- Slow time-to-market for new features
- Expensive engineer time (15 teams × 5 days = 75 days/month)
- Product teams frustrated with infrastructure delays

#### 3. High Error Rate

**Problem**: 40% of infrastructure deployments require remediation.

**Common Errors**:

- ❌ Syntax mistakes in HCL/Bicep
- ❌ Missing dependencies (VNet created before subnets fail)
- ❌ Hard-coded values causing conflicts
- ❌ Incorrect SKU tiers (Standard instead of Premium for production)
- ❌ Missing outputs (connection strings not exported)
- ❌ State file conflicts in Terraform

**Impact**:

- Delays cascade to application deployments
- Engineers lose confidence in IaC
- Teams revert to manual Portal deployments

#### 4. Security Vulnerabilities

**Problem**: Security audit discovered 23 critical findings across infrastructure.

**Findings**:

- 🔴 **12 databases** with public endpoints exposed
- 🔴 **8 App Services** without managed identities
- 🔴 **18 NSGs** with overly permissive rules (0.0.0.0/0)
- 🔴 **5 storage accounts** without encryption at rest
- 🟡 **35 resources** missing required tags (CostCenter, Owner)
- 🟡 **20 resources** using outdated TLS 1.0/1.1

**Impact**:

- Compliance risk (SOC 2, ISO 27001 certifications)
- Potential data breach exposure
- Customer trust concerns
- Remediation effort: Significant engineering time investment required

#### 5. Knowledge Silos

**Problem**: Infrastructure expertise concentrated in 3-4 senior engineers.

**Consequences**:

- Bottleneck for code reviews
- Junior engineers copy-paste code without understanding
- No onboarding materials for new hires
- Bus factor risk (what if key person leaves?)

#### 6. No Automated Testing

**Problem**: Infrastructure changes deployed without validation.

**Risk Scenarios**:

- NSG rules accidentally block application traffic
- Database connection strings misconfigured
- Private endpoint DNS not resolving
- SKU changes cause unexpected downtime

**Impact**:

- Production incidents due to infrastructure changes
- Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) increased 40%
- On-call burden for engineers

---

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- **Azure-only**: Multi-cloud not required (but Terraform chosen for future optionality)
- **Existing subscriptions**: Must work with current subscription structure
- **Network topology**: Existing hub-spoke network must be preserved
- **Compliance**: Must meet SOC 2 and ISO 27001 requirements

### Business Constraints

- **Budget**: Limited implementation budget (consulting + tools)
- **Timeline**: 3 months to pilot with 3 teams, 6 months full rollout
- **Training**: Max 2 days per team for training
- **Change management**: Can't disrupt current production deployments

### Organizational Constraints

- **Skill levels**: Mix of junior and senior engineers
- **Resistance to change**: Some teams prefer current tools
- **Time allocation**: Engineers only have 20% time for this initiative
- **Leadership support**: CTO committed, but VP Engineering skeptical

---

## Out of Scope (Phase 1)

The following are **not** part of this initial project:

- ❌ Kubernetes/AKS deployments (separate initiative)
- ❌ Multi-cloud (AWS/GCP) support
- ❌ Migration of existing infrastructure (Phase 2)
- ❌ Application code deployment (handled by CI/CD)
- ❌ Data migration or database schema management
- ❌ Custom Azure Policy definitions (use built-in policies)

These may be addressed in future phases after initial success.

---

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Pilot (Weeks 1-4)

- Select 3 teams for pilot
- Build core modules (networking, app-service, database)
- Deploy to dev environments only
- Gather feedback and iterate

### Phase 2: Expand (Weeks 5-8)

- Refine modules based on pilot feedback
- Add staging and prod support
- Implement CI/CD pipelines
- Train additional 5 teams

### Phase 3: Rollout (Weeks 9-12)

- Onboard remaining 7 teams
- Migrate 1-2 production workloads
- Document lessons learned
- Plan Phase 2 (migration of existing infra)
