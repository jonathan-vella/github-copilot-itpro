# Five-Agent Workflow: Complete Conversation Transcript

This document shows a complete conversation demonstrating all five agents working together
to design and implement Azure infrastructure for Contoso Healthcare's patient portal.

**Character**: Sarah Chen, Solutions Architect at Meridian Systems (SI Partner)  
**Client**: Contoso Healthcare Inc.  
**Project**: HIPAA-compliant patient portal  
**Duration**: ~45 minutes across all stages

---

## Stage 0: Planning with @plan (5-10 minutes)

### Starting the Conversation

**Sarah**: I have a new client engagement - Contoso Healthcare needs a patient portal for
appointment scheduling. They have 10,000 patients, $800/month budget, and HIPAA compliance
is mandatory. I want to plan this infrastructure project before jumping into architecture
or code. Can you help me break this down?

**@plan Agent**: I'd be happy to help you plan this infrastructure project. Before we dive in,
let me ask a few clarifying questions to ensure we create a comprehensive plan:

**Clarifying Questions:**

1. **Timeline**: What's the target launch date? Is this a hard deadline or flexible?

2. **Team Expertise**: What Azure/IaC experience does the implementation team have?

   - Expert (can handle complex patterns)
   - Intermediate (comfortable with managed services)
   - Beginner (need guided approach)

3. **Integration Requirements**: Does this need to integrate with any existing systems?

   - Existing EHR/EMR system?
   - Identity provider (Azure AD, existing IdP)?
   - Other internal systems?

4. **Availability Requirements**: What's the acceptable downtime?

   - 99.9% (8.76 hours/year) - Standard
   - 99.95% (4.38 hours/year) - High
   - 99.99% (52 minutes/year) - Mission Critical

5. **Data Residency**: Any geographic restrictions on where data must reside?

**Sarah**: Great questions! Let me answer:

1. Timeline: 12 weeks, somewhat flexible but stakeholders are eager
2. Team: Intermediate - comfortable with Azure portal, limited IaC experience
3. Integration: Yes, existing EHR via REST API, Azure AD for staff authentication
4. Availability: 99.9% SLA is acceptable
5. Data: US regions only for HIPAA compliance

**@plan Agent**: Thank you for those details. Based on your requirements, here's a
structured implementation plan:

2. **Get Architecture Assessment**: Use Azure Principal Architect for WAF scoring
3. **Create Implementation Plan**: Use Bicep Planning Specialist for detailed specs
4. **Generate Infrastructure Code**: Use Bicep Implementation Specialist

**Would you like me to hand off to the ADR Generator to document the key architectural
decisions, or proceed directly to the Azure Principal Architect for detailed assessment?**

---

**Sarah**: This is a great plan. Let's skip the ADR for now and go straight to architecture
assessment. I want to validate the service choices before we commit.

## Stage 1: Architecture Assessment (10-15 minutes)

### Agent Transition

**[azure-principal-architect agent auto-selects via handoff]**

**Sarah**: Based on the plan we just created, I need a detailed Azure Well-Architected
Framework assessment for this patient portal. Key requirements:

- $800/month budget
- HIPAA compliance mandatory
- 99.9% SLA
- 10,000 patients, 50 staff
- REST API integration with existing EHR
- US regions only

Can you assess this against the WAF pillars and recommend specific Azure services?

### Understanding the Architecture

**azure-principal-architect**: I'll assess this healthcare scenario against the Azure
Well-Architected Framework. Let me first clarify my understanding and ask a few
architecture-specific questions:

**Architecture Discovery Questions:**

1. **Authentication Model**: Should patients authenticate via:

   - Azure AD B2C (Microsoft-managed consumer identity)
   - Existing patient portal credentials (federated)
   - Simple email/password with MFA

2. **Data Sensitivity Levels**: What data categories will be stored?

   - PHI (Protected Health Information) - requires highest protection
   - PII (Personally Identifiable Information) - names, contact info
   - Non-sensitive (appointment metadata only)

3. **Integration Pattern**: For the EHR REST API:

   - Is it exposed to internet or requires VPN/private connection?
   - What authentication does the EHR API use?
   - Expected transaction volume (appointments/day)?

4. **Disaster Recovery**: What's the acceptable data loss?
   - RPO (Recovery Point Objective): minutes, hours, or daily?

**Sarah**: Excellent questions! Here are the answers:

1. Azure AD B2C for patients - we want Microsoft-managed identity
2. PHI will be stored - appointment data includes medical context
3. EHR API is internal, requires VPN. Uses certificate auth. ~500 appointments/day
4. RPO of 1 hour is acceptable, but we can't afford a DR site in the budget

---

### Detailed Analysis by Pillar

#### 🔐 Security (9/10)

**Strengths:**

- Azure AD B2C provides enterprise-grade identity with MFA
- Private endpoints eliminate public exposure for data services
- Key Vault with managed identity (no credentials in code)
- TLS 1.2+ enforced on all services
- SQL TDE (Transparent Data Encryption) for PHI at rest

**Considerations:**

- VPN integration for EHR requires careful network design
- Certificate management for EHR API needs process

**HIPAA Compliance Mapping:**

| HIPAA Requirement                      | Azure Implementation         | Status |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------ |
| Access Controls (164.312(a))           | Azure AD B2C + RBAC          | ✅     |
| Audit Controls (164.312(b))            | Log Analytics + App Insights | ✅     |
| Integrity Controls (164.312(c))        | SQL TDE + HTTPS              | ✅     |
| Transmission Security (164.312(e))     | TLS 1.2, Private Endpoints   | ✅     |
| Encryption at Rest (164.312(a)(2)(iv)) | SQL TDE, Storage Encryption  | ✅     |

#### 🛡️ Reliability (7/10)

**Strengths:**

- App Service S1 provides 99.95% SLA
- SQL Standard tier provides 99.99% SLA
- Application Insights for proactive monitoring

**Trade-offs (Budget Constrained):**

- Single region deployment (no DR site)
- Zone redundancy available but optional at S1 tier
- RPO of 1 hour achieved via point-in-time restore

**Composite SLA Calculation:**

```
App Service (99.95%) × SQL Database (99.99%) × Key Vault (99.99%)
= 99.93% (exceeds 99.9% requirement)
```

**Why not higher score?**

- No multi-region failover (budget constraint)
- Manual failover procedures required for region failure

#### ⚡ Performance (8/10)

**Capacity Analysis:**

- 60 concurrent users = ~10 requests/second peak
- App Service S1 supports 100+ RPS easily
- SQL S2 (50 DTU) handles 500 appointments/day with headroom

**Sizing Rationale:**

- App Service S1: 1.75GB RAM, adequate for .NET web app
- SQL S2: 50 DTU, ~250 IOPS, sufficient for OLTP pattern
- Redis Cache: Not needed at this scale (adds $50/month)

#### 💰 Cost Optimization (9/10)

**Monthly Cost Breakdown:**

| Service              | SKU              | Monthly Cost   | Justification             |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| App Service Plan     | S1 (2 instances) | $146           | HA within zone            |
| Azure SQL Database   | S2 (50 DTU)      | $150           | PHI storage, TDE included |
| Azure AD B2C         | 50K MAU          | $0             | First 50K free            |
| Key Vault            | Standard         | $3             | Secrets + certificates    |
| Log Analytics        | 5GB/day          | $25            | HIPAA audit logging       |
| Application Insights | Standard         | $15            | APM for troubleshooting   |
| Private Endpoints    | 2 endpoints      | $15            | SQL + Key Vault           |
| **Total**            |                  | **$354/month** | **56% under budget**      |

**Optimization Opportunities:**

- Reserved Instances (1-year): Save 30% on App Service + SQL

**Ready to generate Bicep templates?**

**[Click "Generate Bicep Code" to hand off to Bicep Implementation Specialist]**

---

**Sarah**: The dependency diagram is exactly what I needed to explain deployment order to
the team. The phased approach aligns with our 12-week timeline. Let's generate the code.

**[Sarah clicks "Generate Bicep Code" handoff button]**

---

## Stage 3: Bicep Implementation (15-20 minutes)

### Agent Transition

**[bicep-implement agent auto-selects via handoff]**

**Sarah**: Based on the implementation plan, please generate near-production-ready Bicep templates.
Use modular design with separate files for each resource category. Include:

- Parameter files for dev and prod environments
- Deployment script with validation
- All security defaults from the plan

### Generating Templates

**bicep-implement**: I'll generate the Bicep templates based on the implementation plan.
Let me create a modular structure with all security configurations.

### Deployment Script (deploy.ps1)

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Deploys Contoso Healthcare Patient Portal infrastructure to Azure.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script validates and deploys the Bicep templates for the patient portal.
    It includes pre-flight checks, validation, and deployment with progress reporting.

.PARAMETER Environment
    Target environment: dev, staging, or prod

.PARAMETER Location
    Azure region for deployment (default: eastus2)

.PARAMETER WhatIf
    Preview changes without deploying

.EXAMPLE
    ./deploy.ps1 -Environment dev -WhatIf
    ./deploy.ps1 -Environment prod -Location eastus2
#>

[CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess)]
param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory)]
    [ValidateSet('dev', 'staging', 'prod')]
    [string]$Environment,

    [ValidateSet('eastus2', 'centralus', 'westus2')]
    [string]$Location = 'eastus2',

    [string]$SqlAdminGroupObjectId
)

$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'

# ... (deployment script continues with validation and deployment logic)
```

---

### Validation Results

```powershell
PS> bicep build main.bicep --stdout --no-restore
# ✅ Compilation successful - no errors

PS> bicep lint main.bicep
# ✅ No linting errors
# ⚠️ Warning: Consider using newer API version for Microsoft.Web/sites (informational)

PS> az deployment sub what-if --location eastus2 --template-file main.bicep --parameters main.bicepparam
# ✅ What-if shows 12 resources to be created
# - Resource Group
# - Virtual Network + 3 Subnets
# - 3 Network Security Groups
# - Key Vault + Private Endpoint
# - SQL Server + Database + Private Endpoint
# - App Service Plan + Web App
# - Log Analytics + Application Insights
```

---

**Templates are ready for deployment!**

**Summary:**

- 9 module files generated
- 1,070 lines of Bicep code
- All HIPAA controls implemented
- Parameter files for dev and prod
- Deployment script with validation

**Next Steps:**

1. Review generated templates
2. Update `sqlAdminGroupObjectId` parameter with your Azure AD group
3. Run `./deploy.ps1 -Environment dev -WhatIf` to preview
4. Deploy with `./deploy.ps1 -Environment dev`

---

**Sarah**: Excellent! The modular structure is exactly what I wanted - each module handles
one concern. The deployment script with pre-flight checks will help my team deploy confidently.

Let me verify the templates compile:

```powershell
cd infra/bicep/contoso-patient-portal
bicep build main.bicep
```

**Output**: Build succeeded! ✅

## Summary: Five-Agent Workflow Value

### Time Comparison

| Stage               | Traditional     | With Agents   | Savings |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Planning            | 1-2 hours       | 5-10 min      | 90%     |
| Architecture        | 4-6 hours       | 10-15 min     | 95%     |
| Implementation Plan | 2-4 hours       | 10 min        | 93%     |
| Bicep Templates     | 6-8 hours       | 15-20 min     | 95%     |
| **Total**           | **13-20 hours** | **45-60 min** | **96%** |

### Time Savings

- **Traditional**: 18 hours
- **With Agents**: 1 hour
- **Time saved per project**: 17 hours (94%)

### Key Benefits Demonstrated

1. **Context Preserved**: Each agent received full context from previous stage
2. **Consistent Quality**: WAF principles applied throughout
3. **HIPAA Compliance**: Built into every layer automatically
4. **Production Ready**: Templates deploy without modification
5. **Documented Decisions**: Architecture rationale captured

---

**Sarah**: This workflow is a game-changer for my client engagements. Instead of 2-3 days
of architecture and coding, I can deliver near-production-ready infrastructure in a single
working session. The handoff buttons make it seamless - no copy-paste, no context loss.

I'll use this for the Contoso engagement and start building a library of industry-specific
prompts for healthcare, financial services, and retail scenarios.

_This transcript demonstrates the complete five-agent workflow from planning to deployment.
The actual implementation is available in `../../infra/bicep/contoso-patient-portal/`._
