# Audit Checklists

## 📋 Overview

The **Infrastructure and Database Migration to Microsoft Azure Specialization** checklist contains two (2) modules:

- **Module A**: Azure Essentials Cloud Foundation
- **Module B**: Infrastructure and Database Migration to Microsoft Azure Specialization workload

---

## Module A: Azure Essentials Cloud Foundation

### Purpose

Module A is required for multiple Azure specializations. It evaluates the use of a consistent methodology and process for Azure adoption that is aligned with customers' expected outcomes, spanning the entire cloud adoption lifecycle. Module A is part of the Module B specialization audit package, and as a requirement must be renewed by audit for all Azure specializations.

### Completion Requirements

To complete or renew Module A, the partner needs to:

- Pass all controls in Module A by providing the specified evidence, **OR**
- Provide evidence of a recent (within two years) Module A+B Pass result

The relevant date for each partner is the **Module B Anniversary Date (AD)** shown in Partner Center.

### Waiver Options

To waiver out of Module A, the partner must provide evidence of:

- A recent (within two years) Pass result for an applicable A+B audit, **OR**
- A Pass result for the AEMSP Control 3.A within the last year

#### Module A Waivers

**All Azure Specializations:**  
When applying to renew subsequent Azure specializations, a previous Module A+B audit Pass result will satisfy the requirements for Module A if the result has been within two (2) years. Partners who have passed an A+B Azure specialization audit within the last two years have satisfied the requirements for Module A in all Module A+B Azure specialization audits, unless otherwise noted.

The relevant Module B Anniversary Date (AD) is shown in Partner Center.

**AEMSP:**  
Partners who have passed Azure Expert MSP V1.9 and later Module 3.0 (in Full and Progress audits) have satisfied the requirements for Module A in all Module A+B Azure specialization audits, unless otherwise noted. AEMSP Partners audit yearly to stay enrolled, and Module 3.A Cloud Adoption Framework is also a yearly control requirement.

> **⚠️ Special Note:**  
> Partners who sequentially waiver out of Module A in multiple Module A+B audits and then subsequently waiver out of AEMSP Module 3.A within a two-year timeline will likely be required to take a Module A audit at Module A+B renewal.

## Module B: Infrastructure and Database Migration to Microsoft Azure

### Purpose

Module B validates that the partner has adopted robust processes to ensure customer success across all phases of deploying Infra and Database Migration solutions, from the assessment
phase to design, pilot, implementation, and post-implementation phases.

Review the following audit checklist tables for more details about each control phase and to learn how the partner will be evaluated for an audit. The same customers may be used for Module A & B.

**Audit Duration:** The estimated length of both modules together is **eight (8) hours**. Each control has one (1) or more requirements and requires evidence the partner must provide for the auditor.

Both the requirements and the required evidence are defined in the following tables. The same or different customers can be used for Modules A & B if they demonstrate requirements.

### 4.2 Post-deployment Documentation

#### Requirement

The partner must provide post-deployment operational documentation to show that their customers are successfully using the new service on Azure. It must include:

- 📋 **Demonstration of how the partner's documents, decisions, architectural designs, and procedures** were implemented for each of the chosen deployment scenarios below, utilizing one option inside each scenario
- 📖 **Demonstration of standard operating procedures** for the business-as-usual operations team that describe "how to" scenarios for each of the chosen deployment scenarios below, utilizing one option inside each scenario. Both scenarios are required.

#### 🎯 Deployment Scenarios (Both Required)

**Scenario 1:**

1. Migration of Infra (Windows Server) to Azure, **OR**
2. Migration of Linux-based applications to Azure

**Scenario 2:**

1. Migration of Microsoft SQL to Azure (including Arc-enabled SQL MI)*, **OR**
2. Migration of MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB **OR** MongoDB database to Azure*

> **⚠️ Notes:**
>
> - Oracle migration to PostgreSQL, Cosmos DB or Azure SQL will qualify in scenario 2
> - Azure includes Microsoft datacenters, Arc enabled Azure on-prem or Arc enabled multi-cloud

#### Required Evidence

The partner must provide evidence and examples for **both of the above scenarios**, across a minimum of **two (2) unique customer projects**. The **two (2) required scenarios** must be demonstrated using **the same customer as in control point 2.1**. The partner may also demonstrate the required two (2) scenarios using more than two (2) unique customer projects as long as the control is demonstrated.

**Timeline:** These projects must have been completed within the past **twelve (12) months**.

**Accepted Documentation:**  
The documentation must be provided for each customer. The documentation must indicate that the overall project objectives were met, including customer expectations. It must demonstrate that the implemented migration met each customer expectations, and it must include a **sign-off for each customer**. Sign offs include an email, or a signed acceptance document from the customer.
