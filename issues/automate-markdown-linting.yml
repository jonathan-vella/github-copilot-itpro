title: "Automate Markdown Linting: Nightly Run & Issue Creation on Failure"
body: "Enhance the existing markdown validation workflow to run every night at 1am (using a scheduled cron job). If markdownlint detects any problems, automatically create a GitHub issue listing all markdownlint errors found. Assign this issue to the copilot coding agent.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Modify `.github/workflows/markdown-validation.yml`: \n  - Add a `schedule` workflow trigger to run every day at 01:00 UTC using cron syntax (`0 1 * * *`)\n  - After running markdownlint, if there are any errors: \n    - Collect the output and create a new GitHub issue in this repo\n    - The issue should be titled "Automated markdownlint problems [YYYY-MM-DD]"\n    - The body should include the list of violations/errors found\n    - Assign the issue to the copilot coding agent\n    - Only create the issue if problems are detected\n\n## Suggested Implementation\n\n- Use a step after markdownlint that checks for nonzero exit code\n- On error, use `actions/github-script` or similar to create the issue programmatically with markdownlint output\n- Ensure the workflow does not create duplicate issues for the same set of errors\n- The workflow should continue to run on push and pull_request events as it currently does\n\n## Action file reference\n\n[.github/workflows/markdown-validation.yml](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/github-copilot-itpro/blob/main/.github/workflows/markdown-validation.yml)"
